            In “Outside the Box,” I interrogate ChatGPT to better understand how
            AI “reasons.” Its like a conversation with an intelligent friend,
            sharing ideas and challenging some of the explanations. AI does not
            possess a personality, but delivers discourse as if it might have
            one. Does that mean its analysis will be objective? Today’s
            experiment shows that it can rise above human subjectivity and help
            to clarify deeper trends in disinformation.

            Without offering a definitive assessment, both AI chatbots judged
            that there was little factual support for the idea that Putin was
            motivated by imperialistic ambitions. When comparing the thesis that
            Putin intended to conquer swathes of Europe with the contrary thesis
            that Russia feared NATO expansion to its most sensitive borders,
            both ChatGPT and DeepSeek called the former the weaker argument.
